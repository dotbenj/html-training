## Exercise 5: Building Tables

### Goal
Create a simple table with headers and a few rows of data.

### Instructions
- Create a document called `exercice-5.html` in the `public` folder of your git repo
- Create a table using the `table`, `tr`, `th`, and `td` tags.
- The table should have at least 2 columns and 3 rows, including the header row.
- Use `th` tags for the headers and `td` tags for the data.

### Verification
Once you have done type `npm run start` in your command line interface and open a new session and type `npm run cypress:open`.
Run the test call `exercise-5` in the cypress interface to validate your exercice.
