## Exercise 3: Creating Lists

### Goal
Create an ordered (`ol`) and unordered (`ul`) list with items (`li`).

### Instructions
- Create a document called `exercice-3.html` in the `public` folder of your git repo
- Construct an ordered list (`ol`) with at least three items (`li`).
- Create an unordered list (`ul`) with at least three items.
- Each item in both lists should contain some text.

### Verification
Once you have done type `npm run start` in your command line interface and open a new session and type `npm run cypress:open`.
Run the test call `exercise-2` in the cypress interface to validate your exercice.
