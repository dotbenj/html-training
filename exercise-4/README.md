## Exercise 4: Adding Links and Images

### Goal
Incorporate hyperlinks (`a` tags) and images (`img` tags) into an HTML document.

### Instructions
- Create a document called `exercice-4.html` in the `public` folder of your git repo
- Add at least two hyperlinks using `a` tags. The links can point to any valid URL.
- Embed at least two images using `img` tags. Ensure the images are correctly sourced and display on the page.

### Verification
Once you have done type `npm run start` in your command line interface and open a new session and type `npm run cypress:open`.
Run the test call `exercise-4` in the cypress interface to validate your exercice.
