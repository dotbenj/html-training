## Exercise 9: Using Divs and Spans

### Goal
Structure content using `div` and `span` tags with class or id attributes.

### Instructions
- Create a document called `exercice-9.html` in the `public` folder of your git repo
- Use `div` tags to create distinct sections on your page.
- Within these sections, use `span` tags to highlight or separate pieces of text.
- Apply `class` or `id` attributes to these tags to demonstrate their usage (Note: CSS won't be used in this exercise, but the class and id attributes should still be included).

### Verification
Once you have done type `npm run start` in your command line interface and open a new session and type `npm run cypress:open`.
Run the test call `exercise-9` in the cypress interface to validate your exercice.
