## Exercise 1: Basic HTML Document Structure

### Goal
Create a simple HTML document with `doctype`, `html`, `head`, and `body` tags.

### Instructions
- Create a document called `exercice-1.html` in the `public` folder of your git repo
- Start your document with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
- Follow it with the `html` tag.
- Inside the `html` tag, include `head` and `body` tags.
- In the `head` tag, add a `title` for your document.

### Verification
Once you have done type `npm run start` in your command line interface and open a new session and type `npm run cypress:open`.
Run the test call `exercise-1` in the cypress interface to validate your exercice.
